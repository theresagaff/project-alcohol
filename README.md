# Write your headline here

### Write your nutgraf here

Make sure your pitch answers the following questions:

- Why this story is relevant ("So what?) and why now?
- What is the single question your story tries to answer?
- Why will this story resonate with your audience?

What else has been done on this topic (provide links)? How is your angle different or fresh?

Describe how and where you found the data with links. Put the raw data (csv, xls, pdf) in a folder called `data` in this folder, and provide a [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IdeVJv7SpbKwD1jMfOlXvIpx-ZwitU-3Y6c4iLqGu7c/edit#gid=1257216346) to your Google Sheet. Show your data work in this Google Sheet â€“ this could be sorting, aggregating, filtering, pivot tables, vlookups, etc.

Write up at least one or up to three findings from your analysis based on the data you found.

- Finding 1
- Finding 2
- Finding 3

Who are some potential human sources you could reach out to for more info?

What is the maximum (best) story possible? What's the minimum (fallback) story if your hypothesis doesn't prove out?

## How to publish and submit your project

1. Make sure you have navigated to your `data-journalism` folder with your terminal first. Clone a fresh copy of this template.

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:JOUR73351/google-sheets-project.git NAME-OF-YOUR-PROJECT-HERE
   ```

2. Remove my git tracking from the project

   ```
   rm -rf .git
   ```

3. Create a new repository on GitHub called `NAME-OF-YOUR-PROJECT-HERE` with the following settings.

4. Run these git commands to initialize the repo. Make sure you've checked `ssh`.

   ```
   git init
   git add -A
   git commit -m "first commit"
   git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME-HERE/YOUR-REPO-HERE.git
   git push -u origin master
   ```

5. Write your pitch in `README.md`.

6. Write your story in and add your assets and charts to `index.html`. Feel free to play around with and change the styles in `style.css`, but you are not required to. Delete the code that you don't need for your story. The story itself should be no less than 150 words and include at least one chart from Datawrapper. You can embed a Datawrapper chart in your story by copying the embed code into your html as I have done in `index.html.`

7. You can preview a local version of your story by running a python server.

   ```
   python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
   ```

   Then, navigate to `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

8. To save a version of your story on GitHub, run the following git commands.

   ```
   git add -A
   git commit -m "YOUR-COMMIT-MESSAGE-HERE"
   git push
   ```

9. To publish, go to the settings of your GitHub repo, scroll down to GitHub Pages, and configure the source to the master branch.
