          Almost 30 years sober, Darrell Killmer created his own Facebook 
          group for recovering alcoholics a few years back.  For a while it was 
          just him and a few hundred others.  Then Facebook changed something 
          in their algorithm, he guesses, and the group started gaining traction. 
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          And then, the coronavirus hit.  
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          “We’re never immune,” Killmer said.  “Even at this point in my recovery, 
          it’s not part of my lifestyle anymore, but there’s nothing stopping me 
          from taking that first drink.”
        </p>

          As the pandemic shuts Americans in their homes, the temptation to drink 
          can be irresistible.  The internet abounds with 
          <a href="https://twitter.com/barstoolchicago/status/1246840749305585665?s=20">memes</a> 
          about drinking away the boredom.  One popular <a href="https://twitter.com/sarahmccammon/status/1245327613264044034">tweet</a>  
          read: “There is no longer AM and PM.  There is just 
          ‘coffee time’ and ‘wine time.’”  It’s a dangerous time for those with alcohol 
          addictions—a population already with a low rate of seeking treatment.

        <p class="g-copy">
          In the United States, thousands of people die from alcohol-abuse related conditions 
          each year.  Many of the top conditions involve sustained liver damage, but others involve 
          specific incidents and the dangers of being impaired from alcohol.

          While it’s possible that drunk driving incidents will go down during 
          quarantine, there are still many risks.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Drinking is a coping mechanism, so it’s natural to see an uptick during a global 
          pandemic, says Paul Gilbert, a professor in Community and Behavioral Health at the University 
          of Iowa College of Public Health.  But drinking to cope is part of the problem for many with 
          alcohol or substance abuse problems.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Gilbert, who studies disparities in drinking among gender, racial, ethnic, sexual orientation 
          and other groups, recently published a <a href=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/acer.13965>study</a> which found that women are less likely to seek 
          treatment through services than men. 
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          “There’s also some historical things around misogyny and sexism, particularly among Alcoholics Anonymous,” 
          he said.  “They’ve come a long way, but there’s that still that history that kind of lingers.”

          When observing the conditions attributable to alcohol abuse that most frequently take the lives of women 
          every year, many more violent or incident-specific conditions arise.  And already, domestic violence 
          has surged around the world during the pandemic, according to the New York Times.  For these reasons, 
          it’s critical that women should be able to access fellowship and support during quarantine.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Part of the reason Killmer made his own group on Facebook was because all the others he 
          found were what he calls “troll groups,” where users ganged up on people posting about 
          relapses and shamed others more often than supporting them.  
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          “They would just slam each other, they would say anything,” Killmer said.  “It just drove me nuts.”

          “Persons who are dependent on substances often have a number of other risk factors for suicide,” 
          according to the <a href=https://www.hhs.gov/answers/mental-health-and-substance-abuse/does-alcohol-increase-risk-of-suicide/index.html>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</a>.

          Killmer believes that the online setting welcomes newcomers in a way that in-person meetings might not.  
          The internet can actually be anonymous—many of the private group’s members don’t have profile images, 
          he says, and don’t turn their cameras on during virtual meetings.   
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          “There is a veritable buffet table of types and kinds [of meetings] that are out there,” Killmer said.    
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          But as the crisis continues, nobody knows for sure yet what’s working to support those in recovery.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          “We probably won’t know for a while what the end result was,” Gilbert said.  “It’s all happening so quickly.”
